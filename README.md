- 👋 Hi, I’m Gladis
- 🏥 I worked for 4 years as a radiology technologist in the Montpellier Cancer Institute 
- 🫁 I'm passionate about applied Data Science in Medical Imaging
- 👩🏻‍🎓 I decided to retrain myself in this field
- 🌱 I finished my Data Analyst training with Open Class Rooms and I just finished my Data Scientist training with Data Scientest. I'm currently in an MLOps training, still with Data Scientest.
- 💼 I did an R&D internship at Avicenna.ai and Nurea Soft, both of which are very promising start-ups in the healthcare industry
